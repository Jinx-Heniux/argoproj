# Argo Decision Making Process

## Context

This documents the basic principles for decision making in the Argo Project, particularly by the bootstrap committee and in the future, by the steering and technical oversight committees, to promote transparency, community participation and better decision making.

## Decisions and Rationales

1) Decisions are made based on consensus (unanimous consent).

Consensus promotes an inclusive consideration of all viewpoints, particularly those voiced by a minority of community members compared with alternative decision making processes such as voting. Concensus means that everone agrees to try a particular course of action, even though as an individuas, one may feel that this may not be the best choice (dissenting opionion).

2) Decisions should reflect the viewpoints of the broader community and encourage community participation in the decision making process.

The highest goal of the Argo Project is to serve the needs of the contributors and users of the Argo Community. The best way to guarantee this is to ensure transparency and community participation in the decision making process.

3) Important decisions should be documented and published, including the context of the decision, the decision that was made, the rationale for the decision, dissenting opinions, and who were responsible for making the decision,

Documenting and publishing decisions results in greater transparency, participation by the community, and understanding of the decisions.
